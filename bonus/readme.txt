Additional task

Welcome to a marvellous world of real estate. All of our consultants are currently busy, so you’ll have to help yourselves.
Inside “input” folder you’ll find 3 sample test sets. Each set consists of multiple files:
-	Jpg files with pictures
-	Json files with tags describing each picture
-	Summary file in which every picture is labelled to a correct room class
Your task is to prepare a brochure/flyer/offer. Make it graphical and modern. Use NLP and text generation methods to utilise metadata and provide a human readable (and well composed!) description of each test set (assume that each test set is a separate flat and you have pictures of all rooms).
Generate your answer into a PDF file (one page per each test set).
No cheating please! During evaluation phase you will get a folder with same structure as "input" directory. Your solution has to generate the mentioned PDF file on the fly.
